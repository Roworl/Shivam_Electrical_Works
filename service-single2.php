                    Reliable Brake Coil Repair & Rewinding for Industrial
                    Safety At Shivam Electrical, we specialize in the repair
                    and rewinding of electromagnetic brake coils used in
                    cranes, hoists, elevators, and other industrial machinery.
                    Brake coils are critical components that ensure smooth
                    braking and safe operation, and any failure can lead to
                    downtime, equipment damage, or safety hazards. With our
                    expertise, we restore brake coils to their optimal
                    condition, delivering performance that meets or exceeds
                    OEM standards.

                      <p>
                        At Shivam Electrical, our brake coil repair process
                        follows a structured approach to guarantee accuracy
                        and long-term performance. We begin with a detailed
                        inspection to detect faults such as winding burns,
                        overheating, or resistance imbalance. Once the issue
                        is identified, we perform coil rewinding with premium
                        copper wire, followed by insulation and varnish
                        treatment to ensure protection against heat and
                        stress.
