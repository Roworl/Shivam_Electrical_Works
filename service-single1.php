                    Your Trusted Partner for Motor & Electrical Equipment
                    Repair At Shivam Electrical, we take pride in delivering
                    specialized motor repair and rewinding services that
                    ensure reliability, efficiency, and long-term performance.
                    We handle all types of electric motors, from single-phase
                    units to heavy-duty three-phase machines, with unmatched
                    precision and care. Every repair begins with a complete
                    assessment, allowing us to identify the root cause of the
                    issue rather than just treating surface-level faults.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-20">
                    Our services cover a wide range of solutions, including
                    burnt winding replacement, insulation testing, bearing
                    replacement, balancing, and alignment. We know that in
                    industrial and commercial environments, motor downtime can
                    lead to significant production losses. That’s why we work
                    with speed and accuracy, ensuring your motor is back in
                    operation as quickly as possible without compromising on
                    quality.

                    efficiency. With energy optimization techniques, we reduce
                    power consumption, minimize unnecessary wear, and extend
                    the service life of your motors. This commitment to

                      <p>
                        At Shivam Electrical, we follow a systematic repair
                        process that ensures accuracy, durability, and
                        customer satisfaction. Every motor repair begins with
                        a complete fault analysis, allowing us to identify
                        issues at their root rather than providing temporary
                        fixes. From rewinding and insulation treatment to
                        precision balancing and component replacement, our
                        process is designed to maximize reliability, reduce
                        downtime, and improve energy efficiency. Before
                        delivery, each motor undergoes strict quality checks
                        to guarantee long-lasting performance in real-world
                        applications.
