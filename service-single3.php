                        Our transformer repair process is carried out step by
                        step to ensure high-quality results. We start with a
                        complete inspection to identify issues such as winding
                        failures, overheating, insulation damage, or oil
                        leakage. Once the faults are diagnosed, we perform
                        coil rewinding using high-grade copper wire, apply
                        insulation treatment, and conduct oil filtration to
                        restore dielectric strength.

                      carried out using premium copper for maximum durability.
                      Insulation and varnish treatments enhance protection,
                      while oil filtration ensures better cooling and extended
                      service life. Damaged parts are replaced with
                      high-quality spares, and each transformer undergoes
                      rigorous load and insulation testing before delivery to
                      guarantee performance under real operating conditions.
                      At Shivam Electrical, we help industries minimize
                      downtime and maintain smooth operations by ensuring
                      their transformers work at peak efficiency.
